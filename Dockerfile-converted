# Use the official NGINX Alpine image as base
# Alpine Linux is preferred for containers due to its minimal size (~5MB base)
# and security-focused design
FROM cgr.dev/ay-ay-ron.dev/nginx:latest

# Copy the HTML file to the NGINX default serving directory
COPY image-matcher-spa.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

# Copy custom NGINX configuration for better SPA handling
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# Expose port 80 for HTTP traffic
EXPOSE 80

# Use NGINX's default CMD from the base image
# This starts NGINX in the foreground, which is ideal for containers
